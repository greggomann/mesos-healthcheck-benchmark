== Test: maximum check throughput ==
* Requirements
  - Should achieve uniform distribution of check container launches over time.
    + Randomized delay can do this.
  - Set zero interval, timeout long enough that no timeouts will occur.
  - Measure check container time-to-launch
* Test parameters
  - Vary number of concurrent tasks
    + Powers of two? 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. concurrent tasks, up to 256?
